        <p>The player will have to guess the answer, just like in Word Guess. This time, though, the player will guess
        with numbers instead of letters.</p>
        
        <p>Here's how the app works:</p>

        <p>There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.</p>
        <p>The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.</p>

        <p>When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.</p>


        <p>Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.</p>
        <p>When they do click one, update the player's score counter.</p>


        <p>he player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.</p>
        <p>The player loses if their score goes above the random number.</p>

        <p>The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.</p>


        <p>When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new
        hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.</p>


        <p>The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a
        means to restart the game.</p>
